# BoundedEnforcement.v — Remaining Cures

Cures 1–30 completed. Remaining:

31. Use the module/functor system to parametrize over carrier types (agent, obligation representations), enabling instantiation beyond nat-indexed records.
32. Extend the temporal model beyond discrete `nat` time: continuous or dense time, concurrency, uncertainty about event ordering, procedural timelines, appeal periods.
