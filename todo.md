# BoundedEnforcement.v — Remaining Cures

1. Model normative conflict: when two obligations impose contradictory requirements on the same agent, define and resolve the conflict (priority ordering, specificity, temporal precedence).
2. Add defeasible norms: obligations that can be overridden by higher-priority norms or exceptions. Replace the current absolute booleans with a priority-indexed structure.
3. Add a severity typing discipline distinguishing categories of punishment (fine, sanction, military action, etc.) with ordering constraints between categories.
